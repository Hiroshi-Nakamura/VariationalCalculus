# VariationalCalculus
Variational Calculus using Minimization.
Variational Calculus is to find a function that gives minimal cost functional (function of function).

In this library, we will express a function by a long vector [y_1,...,y_n], which is the value corresponding to each x, i.e. x_1,...x_n.
